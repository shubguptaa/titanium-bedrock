In today’s dynamically evolving technology landscape, public and private sector organisations are eager to leverage AI and automation to optimise their operations, but don’t necessarily know where to start. From analysis public data to streamlining processes, there are so many real world applications of AI that government agencies are struggling to create a plan on how to enhance their operations in an ethical and transparent manner while considering ethics, data privacy and security and winning over public trust. There seems to be a real need as well as hesitance around usage of AI, specially in the public sector.

This is where our solution, Titanium comes into play. Titanium is a RAG Application built using Amazon Bedrock and trained on gigabytes of publicly available workforce and task based data. Titanium analyses an organisation’s operations by performing an assessment and breaking down each employee’s work into individual tasks. It assesses which tasks can be  accelerated using AI, revealing insights like jobs or functions in an organisation that can benefit the most from AI. This gives executives and decision makers a practical guide on how they can harness this powerful technology, all while addressing concerns around data governance, security and privacy.
